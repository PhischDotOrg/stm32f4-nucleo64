# stm32f4-nucleo64
"Hello World"-like Example for the STM Nucleo64 Board.

The Board I have uses STM32F411RE but the code may work for other, STM32F4-based
Nucleo64 boards.

# How to check out
This project makes use of git's [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) feature. This repository is therefore more of a front-end for other code parts. In order to obtain all the needed code, please check out with the `--recursive` flag.

Example:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:PhischDotOrg/stm32f4-nucleo64.git --recursive
```
